    <p class="reflections"> As of late, I primarily use the internet for work. Even before starting my job in marketing for a startup, I was already fairly chronically online, so I can’t attribute my internet use solely to work. However, since starting this job, I’ve definitely noticed a significant increase in my screen time. The platform I use most for work is TikTok, as it’s my leading source of inspiration. I’m constantly scrolling to find the next trend or to get new ideas for how I can market the app. </p>

    <p class="reflections"> In these three screenshots, I’m catching up on work. In the first one, I’m in a WeWork phone booth reviewing last month’s video stats before joining a Zoom call. In the second, I’m at the airport watching a video submission someone sent me. And in the last one, I’m responding to emails from people interested in creating content with the company.</p>

    <p class="reflections"> Regarding my hopes for the internet in the future, I hope it becomes a more uplifting and empowering space for women in particular. Growing up, I remember encountering websites that were hateful and negative toward young women, often spreading rhetoric that was deeply harmful to self-image — similar to the celebrity gossip magazines you’d see at the grocery store. I would love to see that kind of content more restricted, so fewer kids grow up feeling insecure about their appearance just because a website told them they don’t look good or that they don’t fit the so-called “beauty standard.” </p>
